In our proposed system, we're focusing on three key algorithms: XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest, with the goal of enhancing prediction accuracy. We perform feature engineering techniques to extract a richer set of features from the dataset. We will compare the performance of these algorithms and select the most effective one. To optimize our chosen algorithm, weâ€™ll perform hyperparameter tuning to ensure it performs well and avoids overfitting. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, we use different accuracy metrics such as precision, recall, f1-score and ROC-AUC. Additionally, we will create a PowerBI dashboard to visualize and explore different features, providing a comprehensive view of our data. With the help of a dashboard, the telecom operators can visualize the churn rate and the differences caused when a customer leaves.
